## Steps to add file or project to GITHUB using cmd!!!

**Before Starting we need to set username and email id using "git config":

$ git config : This command sets the author name and email address respectively to be used with your commits.

		Syntax : git config --global user.name “[name]”  
			   git config --global user.name "abc"


		Syntax: git config --global user.email “[email address]”
			   git config --global user.emali "abc@gmail.com"

$ git status: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
		Syntax : git status
=======================================================================================================================

1) git init: The git init command initialize a new, empty Git repository.	
	     It generates a file as ".git" which is by default hidden.
	    	Syntax: git init

2) git add:  The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. 
	     It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
	     One can add single or multiple Files.
		Syntax : git add . (add all files in the folder)
			 git add [filename] (adds single file)

3) git commit: In Git, commit is the term used for saving changes. 
	       Git does not add changes to a commit automatically. 
	       You need to indicate which file and changes need to be saved before running the Git commit command. 
		Syntax : git commit -m “[ Type in the commit message]”

4) git remote: This command is used to connect your local repository to the remote repository.
		Syntax : git remote add [variable name] [Remote Server Link]
				git remote add origin master(or main)	
###############	
   
Optional Step - 
-> Github recently renamed master branch as main branch.
-> In git bash if it is still showing master branch, then rename it.
-> $ git branch -m master main

OR

-> Rename main to master on github itself and follow the remaining steps as it is.

**** If there are already file in repository then we first need to pull those files and then push it.

5) git pull:This command fetches and merges changes from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository
		Syntax : git pull [variable name] [branch name]
				git pull origin master(or main)
				
				**Try Either of these commands if it shows error!!
				git pull [Repository Link]
				OR
				git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories


6) git push: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
		Syntax : git push [variable name] [branch name] 
				git push origin master(or main) (The main branch is called master)

7) git stash: It temporarily stashes changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
		Syntax : git stash

8) git stash pop: Popping your stash removes the changes from your stash and reapplies them to your working copy.
		Syntax : git stash pop

9) git stash apply: Reapply the changes to working copy and also keep them in the stash.
		Syntax : git stash apply

10) git clone: It is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository locally on device.
		Syntax : git clone [repo HTTP/SSH url]

11) git checkout: It is used to switch between branches of same repository.
		Syntax: git checkout [branch name]

12) git log: It is used to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository.
		Syntax: git log

13) **git reset: It is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git Repository.
